# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a fundamental but crucial step in the design process that serves as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It creates a visual representation of a website or application's layout and structure. These simplified, low-fidelity sketches focus on functionality, content organization, and user flow rather than visual design elements like colors, typography, or images.

## Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframing serves as a blueprint for your digital product, allowing designers and stakeholders to:

- **Clarify functionality** before investing in detailed design work
- **Identify navigational and usability issues** early in the development process
- **Focus on user experience** without getting distracted by aesthetics
- **Facilitate communication** between team members and stakeholders
- **Save time and resources** by resolving structural problems before high-fidelity design begins

## When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are most valuable during the early stages of the design process, after you've defined your project requirements but before moving into detailed visual design. They bridge the gap between conceptual ideas and concrete designs.

## Types of Wireframes

1. **Low-fidelity wireframes** - Simple sketches, often hand-drawn
2. **High-fidelity wireframes** - Detailed mockups incorporating limited visual elements

By investing time in wireframing, design teams can establish a solid foundation for creating intuitive, user-friendly digital products.
