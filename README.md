# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a fundamental but crucial step in the design process that serves as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It creates a visual representation of a website or application's layout and structure. These simplified, low-fidelity sketches focus on functionality, content organization, and user flow rather than visual design elements like colors, typography, or images.

## Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframing serves as a blueprint for your digital product, allowing designers and stakeholders to:

- **Clarify functionality** before investing in detailed design work
- **Identify navigational and usability issues** early in the development process
- **Focus on user experience** without getting distracted by aesthetics
- **Facilitate communication** between team members and stakeholders
- **Save time and resources** by resolving structural problems before high-fidelity design begins

## When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are most valuable during the early stages of the design process, after you've defined your project requirements but before moving into detailed visual design. They bridge the gap between conceptual ideas and concrete designs.

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes are the most basic type of wireframing. They are usually basic representations of the user interface that focus on layout and structure without any visual design elements. It is so simplistic that paper and pen will suffice as a way to represent your ideas. 

**Characteristics:**
- Hand-drawn sketches or simple digital outlines
- Use of placeholders for content (e.g., lorem ipsum text, image boxes)
- Basic shapes such as squares, triangles, circles and lines are used to represent UI elements
- No color, typography, or detailed visual elements
- Quick to create and easy to modify

**When to use:**
- Early ideation and brainstorming sessions
- Rapid prototyping and exploring multiple concepts
- Initial stakeholder meetings to gather feedback on direction
- When focusing purely on information architecture and user flow

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes are detailed representations that begin to incorporate visual design elements while still focusing primarily on structure and functionality. Visual markers amd branding signifiers like colors, graphics, and font style are included to make them look more realistic. A designer might even choose to add in images at this stage. 

**Characteristics:**
- Precise layout with accurate spacing and proportions
- Some visual design elements like typography, color, and imagery
- Realistic content instead of placeholders
- Interactive elements may be included
- More detailed annotations about functionality

**When to use:**
- Later in the design process, after validating structure
- When communicating final designs to stakeholders
- As a transition step between wireframing and visual design
- For advanced user testing with near-final layouts

## Wireframe Analysis

From the analysis, we can conclude the above the figma design is a high fidelity wireframe.
Visual markers and branding signifiers can be clearly ascertained from the wireframe making it clear to choose high fidelity as its type.
